Raw data can be found in our fitbir repository (fitbir.nih.gov) under reference number FITBIR-STUDY0000339.

Note that functions from the Group ICA of fMRI toolbox (GIFT; https://github.com/trendscenter/gift) and SPM12 (https://github.com/spm/spm12) are used in the scripts as well. 
Cohen's d effect sizes were computed using the computeCohen_d.m function (https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62957-computecohen_d-x1-x2-varargin).

Line plots were made using: https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-raacampbell-shadederrorbar.

Brain regions and states were visualized using: https://github.com/mingruixia/BrainNet-Viewer.
